# apb_gpio_verilog
This project implements a General Purpose Input/Output (GPIO) module using Verilog, designed to communicate with a system bus via the AMBA APB (Advanced Peripheral Bus) protocol. The design supports register-based configuration and control of GPIO pins, with parameterized width and direction control for flexible integration in SoC designs.
